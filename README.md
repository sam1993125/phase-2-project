# Phase 2 Project 

## Flatiron Art Salon 

The function of our app is for users to be able to search artworks by medium. We are pulling from our database that we create. Once the search is completed, a list of artwork cards will show up, with a comment section and a like button. The user will be able to submit their own artwork of choice which will include the name of the artwork, artist name, medium, year, image URL and a submit button.
